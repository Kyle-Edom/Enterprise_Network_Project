# Enterprise_Network_Project
## Overviewüñ•Ô∏èüìä
This project utilizes Cisco Packet Tracer to prototype an enterprise network for a theoretical marketing and brand management company while emphasizing comprehensive and professional documentation throughout the development process.  

The network is designed with high redundancy, incorporating two core routers and multilayer switches, along with dual uplinks to the ISP. Each department operates within its own subnet, ensuring efficient traffic management and security. A comprehensive IP addressing scheme has been implemented alongside OSPF to optimize network performance and scalability. The architecture also includes a dedicated server room, hosting DHCP, Web, DNS, and FTP servers to support network services. Additionally, a wireless network has been implemented to provide seamless connectivity.   

Comprehensive network design documentation has been developed to present all critical aspects in a clear and accessible format. Furthermore, all network configurations have been thoroughly documented for future reference, demonstrating the project's alignment with real-world networking best practices.
